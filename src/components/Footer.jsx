    2019-based CPI basket. While they are indicative of the average transaction
    price levels in the same base period, they are not a measure of pure price
    movements across CPI baskets due to changes in the sample of
    brands/varieties and outlets priced. 2. For more information on the CPI
    rebasing, refer to the Information Paper “Rebasing of the Consumer Price
